# Content

Manage Contentful like you manage your database... With Ecto!

Content is a library that can be used to manage both the structure of your data on Contentful as well as the data itself. We have taken inspiration from Ecto with the hope of creating an easy to understand library with a small learning curve due to the similarities we have with Ecto.

This library is in fact a simple wrapper around Ecto with specific added functionality to integrate it with the Contentful API.
